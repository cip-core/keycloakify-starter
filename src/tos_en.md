# Terms of Service

## Presentation / Features

The CIP Datalab is a service (hereinafter referred to as "the service") implemented by <name of the company>.

The CIP Datalab is an implementation of free software [Onyxia] (https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia) created and maintained by the innovation and technical instruction division of INSEE (information system management / innovation unit and information system strategy).

The CIP Datalab is a platform offering a "datalab" intended for _data science_ experiments on open data in which users can orchestrate services dedicated to the practice of _data science_ (development environments, databases, etc.). This service offer thus aims to familiarize users with new methods of collaborative work mobilizing _open source_ statistical languages (R, python, Julia, etc.), _cloud computing_ type technologies, as well as to allow experimentation with innovative statistics. The services offered are standard.

The CIP Datalab is aimed at employees of <company name>, enabling cross-departmental collaboration and cooperation with their ecosystem. Access can thus be granted on request and after decision of the governance bodies of the CIP Datalab to external collaborators and involved in the realization of experimental projects.

The CIP Datalab allows:

-   the orchestration of _data science_ trainings
-   access to _data science_ services
-   secure public data storage
-   management of secrets, such as encryption keys
-   access to a code management service
-   orchestration of data processing flows

## Roles, commitments and associated responsibilities

The service is made available by the CIP team without any other express or implied warranties than those provided herein.

The service is based on reference open source technologies. However, it is not guaranteed that it is free of anomalies or errors.

The service is therefore made available **without guarantee as to its availability and performance**. As such, the CIP team cannot be held responsible for any loss and/or damage, of any nature whatsoever, which may be caused as a result of a malfunction or unavailability of the service. Such situations will not give rise to any financial compensation.

## Creating an account on the CIP Datalab

Access to the CIP Datalab requires authentication through the company's OpenID Connect identity provider (IdP). Although technically possible, there are no plans to enable a user account creation function.

## Processing of personal data

Data processing is based on the performance of the mission of providing a platform dedicated to experimentation and learning about data science for the benefit of the company.

The Service only collects the data strictly necessary for its implementation.

The processing of personal data within the meaning of Articles 9 and 10 of general data protection regulation (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, belonging union, criminal convictions ...) is banned on the CIP Datalab.

Personal data processed as part of an experiment carried out by a user, when there is any, is the responsibility of the entity administrative office from which the user originated.

The arrangements for their treatment must be communicated by the user to the data protection officer of his entity administrative unit.

Regarding the scope of the CIP Datalab service, the purpose of processing concerns the management of the platform's accounts (creation / conservation / deletion), operation of the platform (monitoring,
usage statistics) as well as the management of the services offered by the platform.

Below is the list of transverse personal data whose processing is under the responsibility of CIP Datalab.
